# Flutter Animated Splash Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide with Code Examples

Are you looking to create an animated splash screen for your Flutter app? Look no further! weâ€™ll walk you through the process of creating a beautiful and engaging splash screen that will leave your users impressed.

### What is a Splash Screen?
A splash screen is a screen that appears when an app is launched. It usually displays the appâ€™s logo or branding and is designed to give the user a sense of what the app is about. A well-designed splash screen can help set the tone for the rest of the app and make a great first impression on users.

### Why Use an Animated Splash Screen?
While a static splash screen can be effective, an animated splash screen can take things to the next level. An animated splash screen can help grab the userâ€™s attention and make the app feel more dynamic and engaging. It can also help set the tone for the rest of the app and give the user a sense of what to expect.

## Steps to Create an Animated Splash Screen with Flutter.
1. Create a new Flutter project if you didn't have already running app.

2. For the first time we need to change the native splash screen and the launcher icon for our app. add flutter_native_splash using terminal.
###


```https
 $ flutter pub add flutter_native_splash 
```
add flutter_launcher_icons using terminal
```https
 $ flutter pub add flutter_launcher_icons
```

at pubspec.yaml file add this lines to change the launcher icon which is located in "assets/logo.png" or create flutter_launcher_icons.yaml file and add these code.

```
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/logo.png"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/logo.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#0C58E5"
  remove_alpha_ios: true
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21
  web:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/logo.png"
    background_color: "#hexcode"
    theme_color: "#hexcode"
  windows:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/logo.png"
    icon_size: 48 # min:48, max:256, default: 48
  macos:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/logo.png"
```
then run this command in terminal :
```https
$ flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons  
```
at the same pubspec.yaml file add this lines to change the native splash screen which is located in "assets/logo.png" or create flutter_native_splash.yaml file and add these code.
```
flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#ffffff"
  image: assets/logo.png
  color_dark: "#000000"
  android_12:
    image: assets/logo.png
  android: true
  ios: true     
```
then run this command in terminal
####  to Add
```https 
$ dart run flutter_native_splash:create   
```
####  to Remove
```https 
 $ dart run flutter_native_splash:remove 
```
3. Add animated_splash_screen.
###
```https 
$ flutter pub add animated_splash_screen    
 ```
4. Add your splash_animation.json to "assets/splash.json"

you can get animations from  [lottiefiles.com](https://lottiefiles.com/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

5. Add lottie package to our app so we can run our animation
command:
###
```https 
$ flutter pub add lottie   
 ```

6- create a stateless widget called SplashScreen which returns AnimatedSplashScreen() widget that requires splash and nextScreen parameters
###
```https
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      body: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        splash: null
        nextScreen: null
      ),
    );
  }
}  
```
7. Add our animation to the splash parameter using Lottie.asset() to load our animation form assets/splash.json and give repeat parameter false value
and don't forget to add an assets section in pubspec.yaml and restart app
###
```https
  assets:
    - assets/  
```

```https
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      body: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        splash: Center(
          child: Lottie.asset(
            'assets/splash.json',
            repeat: false
          ),
        ),
        nextScreen: null,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
8. Define the navigation to the HomePage() as nextScreen parameter
###

```https
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:portfolio/home_page.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      body: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        splash: Center(
          child: Lottie.asset(
            'assets/splash.json',
            repeat: false
          ),
        ),
        nextScreen: const HomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
9. give the animation a splashIconSize and duration
###
```https
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:portfolio/home_page.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      body: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        splash: Center(
          child: Lottie.asset(
            'assets/splash.json',
            repeat: false
          ),
        ),
        nextScreen: const HomePage(),
        splashIconSize: 250,
        duration: 1600,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
10. add some transitions to make our animation more beauty by using
SplashTransition and page_transition package
###
```https
 $ flutter pub add page_transition      
```
```https
import 'package:animated_splash_screen/animated_splash_screen.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:page_transition/page_transition.dart';
import 'package:portfolio/home_page.dart';
import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';

class SplashScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return  Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      body: AnimatedSplashScreen(
        backgroundColor: const Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        splash: Center(
          child: Lottie.asset(
            'assets/splash.json',
            repeat: false
          ),
        ),
        nextScreen: const HomePage(),
        splashIconSize: 250,
        duration: 1600,
       splashTransition: SplashTransition.fadeTransition,
       pageTransitionType: PageTransitionType.leftToRight,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
11- go to MyApp() widget and add SplashScreen() as home for the MaterialApp widget
###

```https
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:portfolio/spash_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Anand Kumar',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      themeMode: ThemeMode.dark,
      darkTheme: Theme.of(context).copyWith(
        platform: TargetPlatform.android,
        scaffoldBackgroundColor: Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
        primaryColor: Color.fromRGBO(21, 181, 114, 1),
        canvasColor: Color.fromRGBO(7, 17, 26, 1),
      ),
      home: const SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```
12- Run the app and ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations !!
